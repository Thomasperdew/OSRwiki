            <h2>Theif</h2>
            <p>
                Thieves sneak furtively in the shadowed alleyways of cities,
                living by their wits. They are often members of the criminal
                underclass, usually trained by a thieves’ guild in the arts of
                burglary and stealth. It is not uncommon for a thief to seek out
                the great rewards that can be gained from the adventuring life,
                especially when circumstances require lying low for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most thieves come from the teeming masses of a large city,
                wherein a thieves’ guild is often the only source of justice and
                exercises as much power as the city’s legitimate government.
                Of course, not all thieves are members of a guild. Some are
                freelancers, evading both the authorities and the guild, living
                on the edge of the knife. Some are even found working
                on the side of the law; agents or spies who use their skills
                in more accepted (though equally shadowy) pursuits. A thief
                character must be of any neutral or evil alignment. Neutral
                good thieves are permitted because of the neutral component
                of their alignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sensible adventuring parties will almost always include a thief,
                for the skills of such a character are invaluable in reaching inaccessible
                places via climb walls, pick locks, and so on. In addition,
                dungeons frequently contain traps which must be located
                and disarmed, and the thief’s cunning and stealth conspire to
                make him or her very useful in a scouting role.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thieves in OSRIC are modelled on characters of fi ction and
                legend, particularly characters from the works of Fritz Leiber
                and Jack Vance. Leiber’s “Lankhmar” series is highly recommended,
                particularly for its description of the operation of a
                typical thieves’ guild; but the high-level thief’s ability to read
                (or misread) magic scrolls is a nod to Vance’s Cugel.
