            <h2>Cleric</h2>
            <p>
                Clerics are moral and spiritual leaders, warriors of faith who
                preach the will of the gods, interpret omens and portents, and
                strike down the evil or unfaithful. Most clerics have a patron
                deity, but some are champions of a particular moral alignment,
                venerating all deities of that alignment in addition to a patron
                deity, and yet others are the servants of a particular pantheon
                of deities. In a world of swords and sorcery, force of arms often
                speaks louder than moral suasion, and clerics are trained to do
                battle against the enemies of their gods. Some clerics are fanatics,
                zealously seeking new converts or hunting heretics. Others
                seem almost burdened by an inconvenient or even oppressive
                relationship with the divine forces. Evil clerics—sinister villains
                who prey upon fear and jealousy—sow discord in the world
                and gather converts for their demonic masters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clerics play an important support role for an adventuring party.
                Most clerical spells are oriented toward healing, strengthening,
                and defending others. However, when the need arises
                the cleric is fully capable of taking a place in the line of battle
                and smiting down infi dels and foes. Clerics employ their holy
                symbols rather than spell books as a focus for their meditation.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a cleric attains ninth level, he or she has accumulated
                suffi cient divine favour and mortal renown to found a temple/
                stronghold. Such places are normally carved from the wilderness,
                in the same manner as a fi ghter establishes a freehold.
                For a cleric to assume the leadership of an existing temple, the
                details are left to the discretion of the GM; a level somewhat
                higher than ninth might be required. Whether the cleric establishes
                a stronghold or a temple, followers and acolytes will
                fl ock to the cleric’s banner.
