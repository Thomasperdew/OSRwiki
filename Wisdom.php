            <h2>Wisdom</h2>
            <p>
                A character’s wisdom score (“Wis”) indicates how “in tune”
                the character is with his or her surroundings. This translates not
                only to general awareness, but also to mystical attunement and
                the ability to understand peoples’ motives. It is, in many ways,
                a measure of the “sixth sense.” Wisdom is the most important
                attribute for clerics and druids.
