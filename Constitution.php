            <p>
                Constitution (Con) is a measure of the characters overall
                health and vitality. A high constitution score can give the character
                bonus hit points (hp), so it is a desirable score for any
                character class. Constitution is also important in two other
                regards, for it determines both a characters ability to survive
                being raised from the dead (Survive Resurrection/Raise Dead)
                and to survive a traumatic magical change in form, such as that
                caused by a polymorph spell (Survive System Shock).
