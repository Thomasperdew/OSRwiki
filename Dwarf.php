            <h2>Dwarf</h2>
            <p>
                Dwarfs are a short and burly race, living in mountain fastnesses
                underground. They are loyal friends and fi erce adversaries,
                known for their steadfastness in all things.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dwarfs are inherently resistant to many spells and spell-like
                effects. Dwarfi sh characters gain bonuses against the use of
                most magic, including all spells, wands, rods, and staves. The
                amount of the bonus depends upon the dwarf’s constitution:
                every 3.5 points of constitution (rounding down fractions)
                grants a bonus of +1 against such magic. Moreover, the hardy
                dwarfi sh nature imparts a similar bonus on any saving throws
                against poison.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dwarfs are not a numerous folk, but they are adventurous,
                loving the lustre of gold, the glitter of gems, and the quality
                of well-wrought metals. Dwarfs can live to an age of 350 years
                or more.
