            <h2>Fighter</h2>
            <p>
                When the clash of steel rings out in dark forests or dimly lit
                dungeons beneath the earth, it is the fi ghter who bears the
                brunt of the combat. Fighters are trained in the use of weapons
                and armour, usually beginning their adventuring careers after
                a stint of training as a town guardsman, soldier, man at arms,
                bandit, pirate, or mercenary.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fighters are the backbone of an adventuring party; without
                them to hold the line, the other members of the party will be
                overrun before they can bring their own skills to bear. Fighters
                are the most powerful characters in melee or missile combat,
                whether on offence or defence. Together with the ranger
                and paladin, they have the most hit points, and their ability to
                survive the most brutal battles is therefore unrivalled.

                They also have the best chance to hit of all the classes, particularly
                at higher level. They may use any kind of armour, shield,
                or weapon. Most fighters look forward to the day when their
                reputations will bring them into the ranks of the lesser nobility,
                where fighting prowess and armed followers are more
                important than high flown bloodlines. It is no small matter to
                carve a freehold out of the wilderness, but to do so is to leave
                behind a legacy in a world where most fortune-seekers die
                an unsung death.

                A fi ghter of 9th level or higher who has built a castle and cleared
                a wide area around it of monsters (at least a 20 mile radius), will
                attract a body of mercenaries to his or her service, provided
                that these are paid a fair wage. He or she will also be able to tax
                each freeholder, at up to the maximum rate of 1 gp per month
                per resident. Some players may choose to retire a character at
                this point, satisfi ed that the character has entered the historical
                records and legends of the campaign world. Others may
                choose to view the stronghold merely as the fi rst step toward
                the pinnacles of mythic power. Such player-held castles and
                villages provide a higher-level party with a base for adventures,
                a stronghold against enemies, and possibly the introduction of
                feudal politics and war into their already-eventful lives.
