                Magic users are a rare breed practitioners of the mysterious
                art of arcane spell casting. A lengthy apprenticeship of
                study and practice allows these somewhat eerie individuals to
                store arcane energy within their minds and to release it in the
                form of spells. Magic users cast spells by speaking a few magic
                words, weaving complex gestures in the air, and employing
                rare and magical materials. While magic users (with illusionists)
                are the weakest character class in combat, this weakness is
                balanced by possessing the most powerful and versatile spells
                in the game.

                The full underlying principles of magic are beyond mortal comprehension;
                even wizards of the profoundest intellect struggle
                from momentary inklings to understand its more complex patterns.
                Nevertheless, those character who possess formidable
                intelligence and a certain intuitive gift, who are willing to devote
                themselves to a lifetime of study, may in time suffi ciently
                master the art to be capable of shifting mountains and shattering
                entire armies. High-level magic users are the most feared
                and dangerous characters in the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Magic users do not gain bonus spells for high intelligence
                scores; intelligence does determine which spells they can understand
                and how many spells they may learn for each spell
                level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Magic users are dependent upon their spell books, and normally
                may only cast spell they have learned from these books
                (exception: magic users may cast spells from arcane magical
                scrolls). Mages may not cast spells from divine, druidic
                or phantasmal magic scrolls. The acquisition of a new spell is
                diffi cult and demanding and must normally be accomplished
                through adventuring, although the mage will automatically
                receive one new spell of the highest spell level that he or she
                may cast upon acquiring a new level of experience.
            </p>

                OSRIC magic users are superfi cially similar to the wizards of
                fantasy literature such as Gandalf and Merlin, but they are
                more closely similar to mages described in the works of Jack
                Vance. His Dying Earth cycle and particularly Rhialto the
                Marvellous are highly recommended.
            </p>

                Magic users are the only class capable of fabricating magic
                items that they cannot themselves employ. Clerics, druids
                and illusionists can fabricate magic items, but only those they
                themselves can use; items such as magical swords, that no
                primary spell casting class may use, are in their creation the
                sole province of magic users.
            </p>

                At 11th level, a magic user may establish a stronghold (usually
                a tower or small keep) in the same manner as a fi ghter.
